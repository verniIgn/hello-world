Hello everybody! My name is Juan Ignacio and I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I suck at Tango dancing, but decent at soccer. I moved to Denver 5 years ago, and I am in love with it. My hobbies are astronomy, astrophotography, playing blues, mountain biking, gaming, and hiking with my dogs. I embrace common sence, respect, Eric Clapton, loyalty... and dark chocolate!
